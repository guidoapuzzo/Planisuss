# Planisuss

The Planisuss Project is a simulation designed to model an artificial ecosystem inspired by Wa-Tor and Conway's Game of Life. It features a fictitious world divided into grid cells, each of which can be water or land. The land cells can host one of three species:

### Vegetob:
a plant species that grows and provides food for herbivores.
### Erbast: 
herbivores that feed on Vegetob and move in search of better living conditions.
### Carviz:
carnivores that hunt Erbast and form social groups called prides.

## Key Aspects:
### Simulation Dynamics: 
The simulation is divided into days, with key actions like growth, movement, grazing, hunting, and reproduction occurring in daily cycles.
### Social Groups: 
Both Erbast and Carviz form social groups (herds and prides) that influence individual behavior, such as whether they move or split from the group.
### Energy and Life: 
Individuals have energy and a set lifespan, which are critical for survival. Energy is gained through eating and lost through activities like moving and fighting.
### Predation and Reproduction: 
Carviz hunt Erbast to survive, and reproduction follows specific rules related to energy and lifespan.
### Ecosystem Balance: 
The ecosystem is regulated by constants (such as cell size, herd size, and energy limits) that prevent overpopulation or extinction.
